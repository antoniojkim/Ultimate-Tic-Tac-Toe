# Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe
This is game that I made. It is a more strategically challenging original Tic Tac Toe game, hence the name, Ultimate Tic Tac Toe. It is played on a 9 by 9 grid instead of a 3 by 3 grid.

The game has similar mechanics to the original game, but in terms of strategy and game play itself, it is very very different. So, included in the application is a instruction page that explains the rules. However, reading the rules isn't going to help much in learning how to play. It is more of a learn-as-you-play kind of game. To further help you learn, the game intuitively highlights the legal moves that you can perform.

There is both a singleplayer and a multiplayer mode. With the multiplayer mode you can challenge your friends to see who is the best. If you want, there is a singleplayer mode where you can face off against an AI that I created. The AI does a depth-first search for all the possible outcomes in the near future and stores these in a tree. It then assigns a weighted value to each leaf and branch using a heuristic function that I developed. These weighted values are summed and the branch with the highest value is the move that the AI makes.

The AI will pose as quite the challenge to a beginner, but it is not perfect. The AI is constantly in the works to be improved.

That having been said, enjoy the game!
